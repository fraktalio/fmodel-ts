# Examples

The example/demo application is publicly available on Github.
It is modeling the imaginary `restaurant and order management` information system.

The domain model is explicitly modeling `events` and `state`, and this is enabling you to: 

- compose the `event-sourced` system
- compose the `state-stored` system

The source code snippets in this reference guide are taken from this application(s).
